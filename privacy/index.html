			<p>GSA uses web measurement and customization technologies to make m.gsa.gov function better for visitors and to better understand how visitors are using the website.</p>
<p>This means that when you visit m.gsa.gov, the internet browser on your 
device may download and save a small file (commonly called a “cookie”) so that our mobile website can recognize your specific device and browser when you use m.gsa.gov in the future.  GSA does not use technologies that track your interactions on 
non-GSA websites.</p>


<h4>How Cookies Work</h4>
<p>Session cookies are used for technical purposes, such as enabling better navigation through the site, facilitating the use of user accounts and generating aggregated statistics about how the website is used.</p>
			<p>Persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited our site. This allows us to improve a user’s experience by, for example, maintaining preference settings, such as always using the mobile site, from visit to visit.</p>
		</div>
		<a class="accordion-item-title">Analytics<i class="icon-chevron-down"></i></a>
		<div>
			<p>GSA uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics) to analyze the data collected through the session and persistent metrics cookies.</p>
			<p>We do view aggregate statistical analyses prepared by our third-party analytics provider, but these analyses do not include any personally identifiable information. </p>
		</div>
		<a class="accordion-item-title">Geolocation<i class="icon-chevron-down"></i></a>
		<div>
			<p>When you visit m.gsa.gov we may use GPS technology to determine your current location in order to make your visit more efficient--for example, when you are looking up a per diem rate. We will never share your current location with any other parties.</p>
			<p>If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings.</p>
		</div>
		<a class="accordion-item-title">Third Party Sites<i class="icon-chevron-down"></i></a>
		<div>
			<p>GSA's mobile site may contain links to sites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations and individuals. GSA provides these links as a service to our visitors.</p> 

<p>When you follow a link to an external site, GSA does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained therein.</p>

<p>GSA does not endorse the organizations or individuals maintaining any external third-party site to which we link. Nor do we share any views expressed, or any products or services offered. </p>
