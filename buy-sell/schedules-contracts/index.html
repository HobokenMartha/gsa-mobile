	<h1>Introduction to Schedules &amp; Contracts</h1>
	<p>GSA uses a variety of contracting vehicles to effectively manage procurement for both its own operations and its government customers.</p>
	<div class="simple-accordion">
		<a class="accordion-item-title">Schedules<i class="icon-chevron-down"></i></a>
		<div>
			<p>Under the GSA Schedules (also referred to as Multiple Award Schedules and Federal Supply Schedules) Program, GSA establishes long-term governmentwide contracts with commercial firms to provide access to over 11 million commercial supplies (products) and services. While the GSA Schedules Program is only one of GSA's procurement vehicles, it is one of the largest programs and the most preferred for commercial products and services.</p>
			<p>The Schedules Program was designed to provide discount resources to all federal agencies worldwide, as well as state and local governments. Under this program, a contract holder can sell to any government agency with just one source, instead of having separate contracts with each agency.</p>

		<div>
			<p>A GSA Schedule BPA is an agreement established by a customer with a GSA Schedule contractor to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acquisition.gov%2Ffar%2Fcurrent%2Fhtml%2FSubpart%25208_4.html%23wp1089547&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH7cX-9W2Xi-N_q1J6FBjRHvx07gQ" target="_blank">FAR 8.405-3</a>). It simplifies the process for recurring needs, while leveraging a customer's buying power by taking advantage of quantity discounts, saving administrative time, and reducing paperwork.</p>
